# vscode-goto-next-previous-member

Visual Studio Code Extension to navigate through the functions, variables, and classes using quick and easy keycommands similar to functionality provided by IntelliJ IDE's (next/previous function) or Resharper (next/previous member)

## Features

This Extension provides two key commands to navigate up and down through the members in your file.

![Next Previous Member Demo](https://github.com/mishkinf/vscode-goto-next-previous-member/raw/master/demo.gif)

## Requirements

vscode@1.28.0+

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following customizable Keyboard Shortcuts:

| Command                                      | Description               | Key Command |
| -------------------------------------------- |:------------------------- | :-----------|
| `gotoNextPreviousMember.previousMember`      | Move To Previous Member   | ctrl+up     |
| `gotoNextPreviousMember.nextMember`          | Move To Next Member       | ctrl+down   |

and the `gotoNextPreviousMember.symbolKinds` configuration setting which accepts an array containing any of the following values:

| Symbol Kind     |
| --------------- |
| "array"         |
| "boolean"       |
| "class"         |
| "constant"      |
| "constructor"   |
| "enum"          |
| "enummember"    |
| "event"         |
| "field"         |
| "file"          |
| "function"      |
| "interface"     |
| "key"           |
| "method"        |
| "module"        |
| "namespace"     |
| "null"          |
| "number"        |
| "object"        |
| "operator"      |
| "package"       |
| "property"      |
| "string"        |
| "struct"        |
| "typeparameter" |
| "variable"      |

All of the symbol kinds specified in the array will be used when moving to the next/previous symbol, omitted symbol kinds will be skipped. If an empty array is provided, all symbol kinds will be used (this is the default).

## Language Support

For the outline to work, the language support plugins need to support symbol information.

For the outline to form a tree structure, the language support plugins need to report the entire definition range as part of symbol.

See VS Code [issue #34968](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34968) and language server protocol [issue #132](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/132) for a discussion.

Here is a list of languages known to work with Code Outline:

Please report any missing extensions and I'll update the list.

## Known Issues

If you are experiencing no movement upon running the command:

I have observed an issue with the Visual Studio API to return symbols from `vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider`. One way I have found to possibly fix the issue is to disable all extensions, restart Visual Studio and then enable all extensions and restart again.
